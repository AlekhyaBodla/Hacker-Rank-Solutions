/*Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. 
 * This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which
 *  each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are 
 *  swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data 
 *  sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Big O of n2 where 
 *  n is the number of items.
 *  after every iteration the highest values settles down at the end of the array. 
 *  Hence, the next iteration need not include already sorted elements*/
